# Overview
As part of my journey as a software engineer, I am building a comprehensive University Management System that integrates with a SQL relational database. The goal is to enhance my understanding of database design, relationships, and SQL queries while building a practical solution for managing student, course, and instructor information.

This software allows users to interact with a database that stores details about students, courses, enrollments, and instructors. It facilitates tasks like enrolling students in courses, assigning instructors to courses, and retrieving relevant data through SQL queries.

The purpose of writing this software is to gain hands-on experience with SQL database design, data modeling, and writing efficient SQL queries. It provides an opportunity to simulate a real-world application and explore best practices for relational database management.

# Relational Database
The relational database used for this project is designed to store and manage information related to students, courses, instructors, and enrollments. 

Students Table: Stores personal information about students, including their name, date of birth, and contact details.

Courses Table: Contains information about courses, including the course name and credits.

Instructors Table: Stores details about the instructors, such as their name and email address.

Enrollments Table: Links students to courses and tracks the enrollment date and grades.

CourseInstructors Table: Associates instructors with specific courses, allowing each course to have multiple instructors.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used the following tools:

Visual Studio Code: A lightweight code editor with SQL extension support.

MySQL: The database management system used to create the relational database and store the data.

SQL Extensions for VS Code: To allow writing, editing, and executing SQL queries directly within the IDE.
